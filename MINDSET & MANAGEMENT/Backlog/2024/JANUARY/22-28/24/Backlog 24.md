## Accomplisments

- *Another, but more in-deep picnic* from **Java SE: Lab#SE02-01** (This time I understood better about things I didn't yesterday. It's a bit clearer what are <u>annotations</u> used for, and also <u>assertions</u>) :sweat_smile: (++)

- *Another, but more in-deep picnic* from **JUnit and DDD** (Rewrited my notes, as they were not really clear to me) (+)

- *Execution* of **MOOC** exercices and also rewriting some parts of my notes, as they were not really clear. Today I started <u>Part 5</u> from **Java Programming I**.

- New questions were added in the ***Pending questions*** section in my notebook.
